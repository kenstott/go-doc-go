    The implementation of distributed consensus algorithms in large-scale systems presents
    significant challenges related to network partitioning, Byzantine fault tolerance, and
    performance optimization. Recent research has demonstrated that traditional approaches
    such as Paxos and Raft, while theoretically sound, face practical limitations in
    environments with high network latency and frequent topology changes. This paper
    presents a novel approach that combines elements of blockchain-based consensus with
    traditional distributed algorithms to achieve improved fault tolerance and performance
    characteristics. Our experimental evaluation across multiple cloud environments shows
    significant improvements in throughput (35% increase) and latency reduction (22% decrease)
    while maintaining strong consistency guarantees. The algorithm handles network partitions
    more gracefully than existing solutions and provides better scalability characteristics
    for systems with thousands of nodes. Implementation details include optimized message
    passing protocols, efficient state synchronization mechanisms, and adaptive timeout
    strategies that respond to changing network conditions. Performance analysis indicates
    that the proposed approach scales linearly with cluster size up to 10,000 nodes while
    maintaining sub-second consensus latencies under normal operating conditions.

    The microservice architecture implements a sophisticated event-driven communication pattern using Apache Kafka as the message broker, with each service maintaining its own dedicated topic partitions for optimal throughput and isolation. The system employs a comprehensive monitoring and observability stack including Prometheus for metrics collection, Grafana for visualization, Jaeger for distributed tracing, and ELK stack for centralized logging. Service discovery is handled through Consul with health checking and automatic failover capabilities, while configuration management utilizes Vault for secrets and environment-specific parameter injection. The deployment pipeline leverages GitOps principles with ArgoCD managing continuous deployment across multiple Kubernetes clusters, each configured with appropriate resource limits, network policies, and security contexts. Performance optimization includes connection pooling, intelligent caching strategies using Redis with clustered configuration, database connection optimization with read replicas and query optimization, and adaptive rate limiting based on current system load and capacity metrics.

     • Very dense academic paragraph: 1000-1500 tokens
     • Headers: 5-50 tokens
     • Code blocks: 100-800 tokens

   🚨 Real problems come from CONTEXT ACCUMULATION:
     • Long paragraph + 5-10 lengthy siblings = 3K-8K tokens
     • Dense technical sections with verbose context
     • Academic papers with extensive cross-references
     • API docs with many similar method descriptions

   📊 Most problematic scenarios:
     • Dense technical documentation: 4K-8K total
     • Academic papers: 6K-12K total  
     • Comprehensive API documentation: 3K-9K total
     • Legal documents with many clauses: 5K-15K total

   🔧 Token management is ESSENTIAL for:
     • Siblings in dense sections (biggest contributor)
     • Parent context in deep hierarchies
     • Comprehensive documentation with verbose content

   💡 Optimization should focus on:
     • Smart sibling selection (by relevance/proximity)
     • Parent context prioritization (immediate vs distant)
     • Content-aware truncation (preserve key information)
