# Project Management Guide

This is the main introduction to our project management methodology. It covers all essential aspects of managing projects effectively.

## 1. Planning Phase

The planning phase is critical for project success. It involves several key activities that must be completed before moving forward.

### 1.1 Requirements Gathering

First, we need to understand what the stakeholders want. This involves conducting interviews and workshops.

Requirements can be functional or non-functional. Both types are equally important for project success.

### 1.2 Resource Allocation

After gathering requirements, we allocate resources. This includes both human resources and technical infrastructure.

Budget considerations play a major role in resource allocation decisions.

## 2. Execution Phase

During execution, the team implements the planned activities. This is where the actual work happens.

### 2.1 Development Process

The development follows an agile methodology with two-week sprints. Each sprint has specific deliverables.

Daily standups keep the team synchronized and help identify blockers early.

### 2.2 Quality Assurance

Testing happens continuously throughout the development process. We use both automated and manual testing approaches.

#### 2.2.1 Automated Testing

Unit tests run on every commit. Integration tests run nightly to catch issues early.

#### 2.2.2 Manual Testing

User acceptance testing happens at the end of each sprint. Stakeholders provide feedback directly.

## 3. Monitoring and Control

Project monitoring ensures we stay on track. Regular reviews help identify and address deviations from the plan.

### 3.1 Progress Tracking

We use burn-down charts and velocity metrics. These visual tools make it easy to spot trends.

### 3.2 Risk Management

Risks are identified and tracked in a risk register. Mitigation strategies are developed for high-priority risks.

## 4. Closure Phase

Project closure involves several important activities. Documentation and knowledge transfer are key components.

### 4.1 Final Deliverables

All deliverables must be formally accepted by stakeholders. This includes both software and documentation.

### 4.2 Lessons Learned

A retrospective meeting captures what went well and what could be improved. These insights benefit future projects.

## Conclusion

Effective project management requires attention to all phases. Success comes from careful planning and consistent execution.
