# Introduction to Document Pointer System

The Document Pointer System is designed to create a universal, structured representation of documents from various sources while maintaining pointers to the original content rather than duplicating it.

## Key Features

- **Universal Document Model**: Common representation across document types
- **Preservation of Structure**: Maintains hierarchical document structure
- **Content Resolution**: Resolves pointers back to original content when needed
- **Semantic Search**: Enables searching by meaning, not just keywords
- **Relationship Mapping**: Identifies connections between document elements

## Architecture

The system is built with a modular architecture that separates concerns:

1. **Content Sources**: Adapters for different content origins
2. **Document Parsers**: Transform content into structured elements
3. **Document Database**: Stores metadata, elements, and relationships
4. **Content Resolver**: Retrieves original content when needed
5. **Embedding Generator**: Creates vector representations for semantic search

For more details, see the [Technical Details](technical-details.md) document.

## Getting Started

To start using the system, you'll need to:

1. Install the required dependencies
2. Configure your content sources
3. Initialize the document database
4. Run the ingestion process
