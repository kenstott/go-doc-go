## Opening Remarks

**Jennifer Park:** Good afternoon, and welcome to TechCorp's (NASDAQ: TECH) third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. I'm Jennifer Park, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me today are Sarah Chen, our Chief Executive Officer, and Michael Rodriguez, our Chief Financial Officer.

Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements regarding our business outlook and financial projections. These statements are based on our current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.

Now, I'll turn the call over to Sarah.

## CEO Commentary

**Sarah Chen:** Thank you, Jennifer, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report that TechCorp delivered another strong quarter with revenue of $4.2 billion, representing 18% year-over-year growth, exceeding the high end of our guidance range.

Our cloud services division continues to be our primary growth driver, with revenue increasing 32% year-over-year to $2.1 billion. This growth was fueled by strong enterprise adoption of our AI-powered analytics platform, which we launched last year in partnership with DataFlow Inc.

In terms of market dynamics, we're seeing increased competition from CloudGiant Corp (NYSE: CLDG) and ServerMax (NASDAQ: SMAX), particularly in the mid-market segment. However, our differentiated offerings and superior customer service continue to win us new accounts. This quarter alone, we added 150 new enterprise customers, including several Fortune 500 companies.

Looking at our product portfolio, our newest offering, the Quantum Computing as a Service platform, is gaining traction faster than anticipated. Early adopters include major pharmaceutical companies using it for drug discovery and financial institutions leveraging it for risk modeling.

## Financial Performance

**Michael Rodriguez:** Thank you, Sarah. Let me provide more details on our financial performance and outlook.

Third quarter revenue was $4.2 billion, up 18% year-over-year, driven by:
- Cloud Services: $2.1 billion, up 32%
- Software Licenses: $1.3 billion, up 8%
- Professional Services: $800 million, up 12%

Our gross margin expanded to 72%, up 200 basis points from last year, primarily due to improved operational efficiency and economies of scale in our cloud infrastructure. Operating margin came in at 28%, reflecting our continued investment in R&D while maintaining disciplined cost management.

Net income for the quarter was $980 million, or $3.25 per diluted share, compared to $750 million, or $2.50 per share, in Q3 2023. This represents EPS growth of 30% year-over-year.

Operating cash flow was robust at $1.2 billion, and free cash flow was $950 million after capital expenditures of $250 million, primarily for data center expansion.

## Business Highlights

**Sarah Chen:** I want to highlight several key developments this quarter:

First, our strategic partnership with AI Innovations Ltd. is already bearing fruit. Their machine learning models integrated into our platform have improved customer engagement metrics by 40% on average.

Second, we completed the acquisition of StartupTech for $500 million, which brings critical edge computing capabilities to our portfolio. This acquisition positions us well against competitors like EdgeCorp and helps us address the growing demand for low-latency computing solutions.

Third, we're seeing strong momentum in international markets, particularly in Europe and Asia-Pacific. International revenue now represents 38% of total revenue, up from 32% last year. We recently established new data centers in Frankfurt and Singapore to better serve these regions.

On the competitive front, while CloudGiant announced aggressive pricing last month, we've maintained our market share through superior technology and customer service. Our customer retention rate remains industry-leading at 95%.

## Risk Factors and Challenges

**Michael Rodriguez:** While we're pleased with our performance, we're monitoring several headwinds:

The macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, with some enterprise customers extending their purchasing cycles. We're also seeing increased regulatory scrutiny in Europe regarding data privacy, which could impact our expansion plans.

Supply chain constraints continue to affect our hardware procurement, though we've mitigated most impacts through strategic inventory management and supplier diversification.

Currency fluctuations, particularly the strong dollar, created a $50 million headwind this quarter, though we've hedged approximately 80% of our foreign currency exposure for the next two quarters.

## Forward Guidance

**Sarah Chen:** Looking ahead, we remain optimistic about our growth prospects. For Q4 2024, we're guiding to:
- Revenue: $4.4 to $4.5 billion, representing 15-17% year-over-year growth
- Operating margin: 27-29%
- EPS: $3.40 to $3.50

For the full year 2025, we expect revenue growth to accelerate to 20-22%, driven by our AI initiatives and international expansion. We're particularly excited about our upcoming product launches, including our next-generation blockchain platform for enterprise customers.

We're also increasing our R&D investment to $2 billion annually, focusing on quantum computing, AI, and cybersecurity. These investments position us to capture the significant market opportunities ahead.

## Q&A Session

**Analyst 1 (Morgan Stanley):** Sarah, can you provide more color on the competitive dynamics with CloudGiant? How are you differentiating?

**Sarah Chen:** Great question. While CloudGiant is competing aggressively on price, we're winning on technology and service. Our AI capabilities are 18 months ahead of theirs according to industry analysts. Additionally, our customer support NPS score is 72 compared to their 45. We're not engaging in a price war; instead, we're focusing on value creation for our customers.

**Analyst 2 (Goldman Sachs):** Michael, regarding the StartupTech acquisition, what kind of revenue synergies are you expecting?

**Michael Rodriguez:** We expect StartupTech to contribute $100 million in revenue next year, but more importantly, their technology will enhance our existing products. We anticipate cross-selling opportunities worth $300-400 million over the next two years. The acquisition is immediately accretive to earnings, adding about $0.10 to EPS in 2025.

**Analyst 3 (JP Morgan):** What's your view on the AI market opportunity, and how are you positioned versus competitors?

**Sarah Chen:** The enterprise AI market is expected to reach $500 billion by 2030. We're well-positioned with our comprehensive platform that includes both infrastructure and applications. Unlike pure-play AI companies, we offer an integrated solution. Our partnership with AI Innovations gives us access to cutting-edge models, while our enterprise relationships provide the distribution channel.

We're also seeing strong interest from customers in our responsible AI framework, which addresses concerns about bias and transparency. This is becoming a key differentiator, especially in regulated industries like healthcare and finance.

**Analyst 4 (Barclays):** Can you discuss your capital allocation priorities, particularly regarding dividends and buybacks?

**Michael Rodriguez:** We maintain a balanced approach to capital allocation. We announced a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.55 per share, reflecting our confidence in cash flow generation. We also have $2 billion remaining in our share repurchase authorization, and we expect to deploy this over the next 12 months.

Our priority remains investing in organic growth, followed by strategic M&A. We're targeting companies with complementary technologies, particularly in edge computing and cybersecurity. We maintain a strong balance sheet with $8 billion in cash and no debt, giving us significant flexibility.

## Closing Remarks

**Sarah Chen:** In closing, TechCorp delivered another quarter of strong execution. We're gaining market share, expanding margins, and investing for future growth. The secular trends driving digital transformation remain intact, and we're well-positioned to capitalize on these opportunities.

Our employees continue to be our greatest asset. We were recently recognized as one of the top 10 places to work in technology, which helps us attract and retain the best talent in a competitive market.

Thank you for your continued support, and we look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.

**Jennifer Park:** Thank you for joining today's call. A replay will be available on our investor relations website. Have a great day.
