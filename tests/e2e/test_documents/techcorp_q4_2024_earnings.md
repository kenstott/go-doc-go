I'm pleased to report that we delivered exceptional results this quarter, with revenue growth of 25% year-over-year, exceeding our guidance. Our AI-powered solutions continue to gain strong traction in the enterprise market.

Our gross margins improved to 72%, up from 68% in the prior year, driven by operational efficiencies and favorable product mix.

## Q&A Session

**Elena Martinez, Analyst - Goldman Sachs:** Thank you for taking my question. Sarah, can you provide more color on the competitive landscape and how you're differentiating TechCorp's AI solutions?

**Sarah Chen, CEO:** Great question, Elena. We're seeing increased competition, but our integrated platform approach and focus on enterprise-grade security continue to be key differentiators. Our recent partnership with several Fortune 500 companies validates our strategy.

**James Wilson, Analyst - Morgan Stanley:** Michael, regarding the guidance for next quarter, can you walk us through your assumptions for Q1 2025?

**Michael Rodriguez, CFO:** Certainly, James. For Q1 2025, we're guiding revenue between $2.4 and $2.5 billion, representing 20-24% year-over-year growth. We expect continued strength in Cloud Services, though we're being conservative given typical seasonality.

**Robert Kim, Analyst - JP Morgan:** Sarah, what are your thoughts on potential M&A opportunities in the current market?

**Sarah Chen, CEO:** We continue to evaluate strategic opportunities that align with our product roadmap. While we have a strong balance sheet that gives us flexibility, we remain disciplined in our approach to M&A, focusing on technology and talent that can accelerate our AI capabilities.
