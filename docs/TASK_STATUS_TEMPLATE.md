# Task Status Report Template

Use this template for all complex development tasks to maintain accountability and transparency.

## Template

```
**TASK STATUS REPORT**
- **Current Task**: [specific task description - e.g., "Implement priority document queuing in WorkQueue class"]
- **Status**: [In Progress/Blocked/Complete]
- **Actions Taken**: [specific commands executed, files modified - e.g., "Modified src/go_doc_go/queue/work_queue.py:164-210, Added tests/test_queue/test_priority_queue.py"]
- **Verification**: [test results, execution output, proof of functionality - e.g., "pytest -m atomic passed 8/8 tests, throughput test achieved 1,200 docs/sec"]
- **Next Steps**: [if not complete, specific next actions - e.g., "Implement priority-based claiming logic in claim_next_document()"]
- **Blockers**: [if blocked, specific technical obstacles - e.g., "PostgreSQL schema needs priority column added, requires migration"]
```

## Example - Complete Task

```
**TASK STATUS REPORT**  
- **Current Task**: Implement distributed work queue Phase 1 (database schema and basic operations)
- **Status**: Complete
- **Actions Taken**: 
  - Created src/go_doc_go/queue/schema.sql with 4 tables
  - Implemented src/go_doc_go/queue/work_queue.py with WorkQueue and RunCoordinator classes
  - Added tests/test_queue/test_work_queue.py with 8 comprehensive tests
  - Created Docker PostgreSQL test environment with tests/test_queue/docker-compose.yml
- **Verification**: 
  - All 8/8 tests passed: `pytest tests/test_queue/test_work_queue.py::TestWorkQueueIntegration -v`
  - Atomic claiming verified with no duplicate claims across 10 concurrent workers
  - Performance test achieved 1,459.5 docs/second throughput
  - All PostgreSQL operations working correctly with proper connection handling
- **Next Steps**: N/A - Phase 1 complete
- **Blockers**: None
```

## Example - In Progress Task

```
**TASK STATUS REPORT**
- **Current Task**: Add document priority support to work queue system  
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Modified database schema to add priority column to document_queue table
  - Updated WorkQueue.add_document() to accept priority parameter
  - Created migration script: migrations/002_add_document_priority.sql
- **Verification**: 
  - Unit tests pass: `pytest tests/test_queue/test_priority_queue.py::test_add_priority_document -v`
  - Schema migration tested locally
  - PARTIAL: Priority claiming not yet implemented
- **Next Steps**: 
  - Modify claim_next_document() to order by priority DESC, link_depth ASC
  - Add performance test for priority-based claiming
  - Update documentation with priority feature
- **Blockers**: None
```

## Example - Blocked Task

```
**TASK STATUS REPORT**
- **Current Task**: Integrate work queue with existing document ingestion pipeline
- **Status**: Blocked  
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Analyzed main.py ingestion flow
  - Identified integration points in ingest_documents() function
  - Started modifying DocumentProcessor class
- **Verification**: N/A - blocked before completion
- **Next Steps**: Cannot proceed until blocker resolved
- **Blockers**: 
  - DocumentProcessor class uses synchronous processing model
  - Work queue requires async/worker pattern
  - Need architectural decision: refactor DocumentProcessor or create new QueuedDocumentProcessor
  - Requires discussion with team lead about breaking changes
```

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use This Template
- Complex tasks taking > 2 hours
- Tasks involving multiple files or systems
- Tasks with potential blocking issues
- Tasks requiring verification steps
- Any task where you need to demonstrate completion

### Status Definitions
- **In Progress**: Actively working, specific next steps identified
- **Blocked**: Cannot proceed due to external dependency or decision needed  
- **Complete**: All functionality implemented, tested, and verified

### Evidence Requirements
- **Commands executed**: Exact bash commands used for testing
- **Files modified**: Specific file paths and line numbers when relevant
- **Test results**: Output showing tests passed/failed with numbers
- **Performance data**: Actual throughput, latency, or memory usage numbers
- **Error messages**: Full error text if debugging issues

### Best Practices
- Update status every work session for complex tasks
- Be specific about what was actually accomplished vs planned
- Include evidence of testing and verification
- Document blockers with enough detail for others to help resolve
- Use this format consistently across the team
